### PageCraft

PageCraft is a **command-line refactoring tool for static websites**.

* Scans existing HTML and **lifts out stateful elements**â€”titles, meta tags, structured data, navigation, and footers.
* **Transplants those nodes** into a new template file.

The result is a **refreshed layout** that preserves all SEO signals, legal notices, and link structures, achieved with a **single in-place rewrite** instead of a full site regeneration.
